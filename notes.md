# Notes

- save copies of neural networks and and their weights and graph them as a 2D heat map
- pre-train functional units and connect dynamically
- load emulator with pre-trained functional units
- dynamically train functional units with built in success checking criteria
- redundant linkages, neurons, inputs, and outputs
- adjustable thresholds
